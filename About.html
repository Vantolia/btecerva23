            <h1>Our History</h1> <section class="about-us">
            <h2><p>The Republic of Turkey, under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's leadership, placed great importance on education. The Turkish Education Association (TED) was established on January 31st, 1928, in response to Atatürk's call for private sector initiatives and societal contribution to education. TED aims to actively contribute to all aspects of education, supporting financially disadvantaged but successful students and making valuable contributions to the Turkish education system.<br>İsmet İnönü, later the second President of Turkey, served as the first chairman of TED. The association's emblem, adopted in 1929, features the crescent, a torch representing education, and stars symbolizing respect for the founding board members.</h2><br><p>TED Schools, inspired by this vision, expanded their reach, with a desire to establish a branch in Kayseri. After the closure of Talas American Middle School, Şahap SİCİMOĞLU, the city's mayor, along with several citizens and Suat BALLAR, TED's Chairman, took the initiative to establish a new educational institution. This led to the opening of a branch in Kayseri on December 21st, 1965, with the support of Rıfat GÖNEN. The Kayseri Municipality Council and Mayor Mehmet ÇALIK allocated the current campus, known as "Kavak Site," to the Turkish Education Association. The campus, initially 8,000 square meters, was expanded to 22,000 square meters. Construction of the three-story TED Kayseri College began on April 28th, 1966, and within five months, a centrally heated building with eight classrooms was completed. The school officially started its educational activities on September 26th, 1966.
<br> In subsequent years, the middle school, elementary school, and high school sections of TED Kayseri College began their education, with various milestones such as the establishment of the School Board and Protective Association, the formation of the first School-Parent Association, and the opening of a school clinic.
<br>During the 1969-1970 academic year, the middle school section produced its first graduates (49 students), while the elementary school section produced its first graduates (11 students). In the 1972-1973 academic year, the high school section had its first graduating class (34 students), marking the first year when all three sections graduated students simultaneously, with a total of 112 students graduating.
<br>The Turkish Education Association Kayseri Branch decided to convert the school into a foundation during an Extraordinary General Assembly in May 1975. Mustafa ÖZBAKIR became the first Chairman of the Foundation Board. Over the years, the school underwent various developments such as the closure of boarding facilities in 1983, the opening of a sports hall in 1993, and the transition to an 8-year primary education system in 1997. In subsequent years, new buildings were added, including a dining hall, conference hall, and additional school facilities. The latest addition was the high school building, which opened in September 2021. TED Kayseri College continues to provide modern educational spaces and has a growing community of students, teachers, staff, and alumni.</p>
