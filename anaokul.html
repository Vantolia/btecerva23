            <h1>About our Kindergarten</h1>
            <h2><p>The purpose of the preschool education program, which forms the first stage of the educational journey, is to support children's physical, mental, emotional, and social development, equip them with skills, foster a positive self-concept, enable self-expression, and promote self-regulation. It aims to ignite their desire to learn, stimulate curiosity, and enhance their creativity. Another goal is to ensure that children speak Turkish correctly and fluently.<br>Our building is designed as a separate structure within the campus and prepared to accommodate different learning styles. It includes multipurpose halls for science, nature, and culinary activities, an art studio, a computer laboratory, a dining hall, indoor play areas, and outdoor playgrounds. The classrooms are spacious, well-lit, and well-ventilated.</h2><br><p>TED Kayseri College Preschool aims to raise individuals who are confident, committed to Atatürk's national and spiritual values, respectful, tolerant, self-expressive, participative, responsible, sensitive to art, and inquisitive. The focus is on meeting students' psychomotor, cognitive, socio-emotional, language, and self-care developmental needs, as well as discovering and developing their talents.
<br> Considering the importance of parent communication and collaboration in early childhood education, parents are informed about their children's development and school activities through various communication channels. Their participation in student activities is encouraged, and seminars are organized for them at regular intervals.
<br>During the 1969-1970 academic year, the middle school section produced its first graduates (49 students), while the elementary school section produced its first graduates (11 students). In the 1972-1973 academic year, the high school section had its first graduating class (34 students), marking the first year when all three sections graduated students simultaneously, with a total of 112 students graduating.
