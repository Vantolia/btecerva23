                    <p>"Ensuring that TED Kayseri College Foundation Schools educate individuals who use at least one foreign language effectively in their lives.” Based on this mission , our annual traditional school trip called "Live it, Learn it Cappadocia!" was organized. Accompanied by licensed guides who only spoke English throughout the whole trip, our students got to know the region and were supported in both their history knowledge and language development by using  English outside the curriculum. They also had a great time with the tourists in the region.</p>
